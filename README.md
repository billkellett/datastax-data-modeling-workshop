# Datastax Data Modeling Workshop
This is a 4-hour introductory workshop on data modeling for DataStax Enterprise.

### Motivation

Datastax is multi-model data platform with NoSQL, Search and Graph databases. There is a paradigm shift if one is coming from relational modeling including distributed database, always available (even if disk fails or server fails or data center fails) & most unique is how to design data model.

With power of distributed database storage layer is seperated from processing layer so any new comer to Datastax may believe that enterprise applications simply cannot be built without familiar relational capabilities such as Joins, ACID, Referential Integrity, etc.  

This workshop teaches new users the principles of Data Modeling in Datastax Enterprise (i.e. DSE).  The workshop methodology does *not* begin with a relational conceptual model (in contrast to Academy courses).  Instead, it teaches key DSE modeling principles, and then uses a "DSE Mindset" from start to finish.

### What is included?

A PowerPoint presentation (with detailed speaker notes) walks the students through DSE Data Modeling with a 4-step approach: Conceptual, Logical, Physical, and Optimization.  We include the following DSE components:

* DSE Core
* DSE Studio
* DSE Search
* DSE Opscenter

### Business Take Aways

DataStax Enterprise is the most capable database for building large-scale modern enterprise applications.  

### Technical Take Aways

By using a few foundational DSE Data Modeling principles, customers can build applications that support:

* Continuous *Availability*
* *Real-time* high-speed high-volume transaction processing
* Highly *distributed* applications
* Unlimited *scalability*

In addition, DSE's *contextual* capabilities support the many different application stakeholders in a modern enterprise, including Customers, Customer Service Representatives, Business Analysts, Data Scientists, etc.
