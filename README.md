# datastax-data-modeling-workshop
This is a 4-hour introductory workshop on data modeling for DataStax Enterprise.

### Motivation

Prospective customers often find DSE Data Modeling to be a stumbling block, because it is very different from relational data modeling.  For example, evaluators may initially believe that enterprise applications simply cannot be built without familiar relational capabilities such as Joins, ACID, Referential Integrity, etc.  

This workshop teaches new users the principles of Data Modeling in DSE.  The workshop methodology does *not* begin with a relational conceptual model (in contrast to Academy courses).  Instead, it teaches key DSE modeling principles, and then uses a "DSE Mindset" from start to finish.

### What is included?

Studio notebooks and a corresponding presentation (with detailed speaker notes) walks the students through DSE Data Modeling with a 4-step approach: Conceptual, Logical, Physical, and Optimization.  We include the following DSE components:

* DSE Core
* DSE Studio
* DSE Search
* DSE Opscenter

### Business Take Aways

DataStax Enterprise is the most capable database for building large-scale modern enterprise applications.  

### Technical Take Aways

By using a few foundational DSE Data Modeling principles, customers can build applications that support:

* Continuous *Availability*
* *Real-time* high-speed high-volume transaction processing
* Highly *distributed* applications
* Unlimited *scalability*

In addition, DSE's *contextual* capabilities support the many different application stakeholders in a modern enterprise, including Customers, Customer Service Representatives, Business Analysts, Data Scientists, etc.
